# Wiki.js Fork — Feature Guide

This wiki runs an **opinionated fork of [Wiki.js](https://github.com/requarks/wiki) 2.x**
maintained at [arsenixprime/wiki](https://github.com/arsenixprime/wiki). It tracks
upstream Wiki.js and layers the features below on top. Everything is **opt-in
through the normal admin UI**; stock Wiki.js behaviour is unchanged until a
feature is turned on.

This page is the rolling, user-facing guide: what each feature does, where to
turn it on, and how to use it. For internals (tables, GraphQL, code paths) see
the technical reference `dev/docs/corporate-workflow.md` in the repository.

**Which build am I on?** Admin → System Info → **Git Build** shows the branch,
commit and date of the running build. Compare it with the
[Releases](https://github.com/arsenixprime/wiki/releases) page.

| `v2.5.314_jp2` | 2026-09-09 | Corporate workflow (Watch, Managed pages, Review/Approve, groups everywhere), mail-failure alert, Private site, Hide "Powered by Wiki.js", Print QR code, customizable load/save animation, Git build info |
| *unreleased* (PR #2) | 2026-09-30 | Staged list editing in the Workflow tab (Apply changes / Discard); fix: saving more than one manager/approver/watcher failed on SQLite and MySQL |

Versions follow the upstream Wiki.js release they are based on, with a `_jpN`
suffix. Docker images: `ghcr.io/arsenixprime/wiki:<version>` (and `:latest`).

## Editing

### Clipboard image paste and drag-and-drop

Paste a screenshot from the clipboard, or drop image files, directly into the
**Markdown** or **Visual** editor. The image is uploaded as a page asset and
a link is inserted at the cursor. Works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

- Pasted images land in the **root assets folder** with a generated name such
  as `pasted_20260930_1412_a7k3.png` (browsers name every clipboard image
  `image.png`, and Wiki.js overwrites assets with the same name, so a unique
  name is generated).
- Dropped files keep their own file name, lower-cased and with spaces replaced
  by underscores, matching how the server stores them.
- Requires the **Upload Assets** (`write:assets`) permission, the same one the
  Assets dialog needs.

## Controlled publishing workflow

Four features that turn a page into a governed document. They are configured
per page in the editor under **Page Properties → Workflow** (the fifth tab).
The tab is only usable on a page that has been **saved at least once**, by
users who can **manage pages** (or administrators). Day-to-day use happens in
the **Workflow panel** in the right-hand sidebar of every page.

### Watch

Be emailed when a page's published content changes.

- **Watch yourself**: open the page, find **Workflow** in the sidebar, click the
  eye icon. Click again to unwatch. Any reader can do this.
- **Assign others**: Page Properties → Workflow → **Watchers**. Managers and
  admins can add individual users or whole groups.
- Emails are **debounced**: a burst of edits produces **one** digest, sent after
  a quiet period (site default 30 minutes; override per page with
  **Notification delay**). The digest includes who changed what, a compact
  stats line and a link to the diff.
- The person who made the change is never emailed about their own edit.

### Managed pages

Restrict direct publishing to designated **managers**; everyone else proposes
changes as **drafts**.

1. Page Properties → Workflow → turn on **Only managers may publish directly**
   and add managers (users or groups). Click **Apply changes**.
2. Anyone else who edits the page sees an orange **managed** banner. Their
   **Save** stores a **draft**, never the live page. Drafts open in the full
   editor (preview, image paste, toolbar, all of it).
3. The author clicks **Submit for review** (in the banner or the sidebar).
   Managers are emailed.
4. A manager opens the page, and in the sidebar's **Drafts** list clicks
   **Review draft** to see a side-by-side diff, then **Publish** or **Reject**
   (with an optional comment emailed back to the author).
5. Publishing records the **author** as the page author, and the manager as the
   publisher. The draft is then removed.

Notes:
- The sidebar shows **Managed page**. Hover or click it to see who the managers
  are.
- Drafts are collaborative by design: any user who can author a draft on the
  page can edit or delete any draft on it.
- Drafts never appear in search, navigation, the page tree or the sitemap.
- Authoring a draft requires normal page-edit rights on the page.

### Review / Approve

Per-revision sign-off by designated **approvers**.

- Page Properties → Workflow → **Approval mode**:
  - **Off** — no sign-off.
  - **Review (informal sign-off)** — approvers are asked to review; the sidebar
    shows "Reviewed by X of Y".
  - **Approve (formal approval badge)** — same flow, and once **every** current
    approver has approved the current revision the page shows a prominent
    **Approved** badge.
- Add approvers (users or groups) and click **Apply changes**.
- On every publish, approvers are emailed. Someone who approved an earlier
  revision gets a **delta** email with a diff since their last approval.
- Approvers act in the sidebar: **Approve** (one click) or **Request changes**
  with a comment, which emails the last editor and the managers.
- Approvals are **per revision**. Any later publish silently un-approves
  everyone until they re-approve. The status list is visible to all readers.

### Groups everywhere

Watchers, managers and approvers can be **users or groups**. Group membership is
looked up **live** every time it matters, never snapshotted:

- Add someone to an approver group and they immediately become a pending
  approver for the current revision. That can move a fully-approved page back
  to pending. This is intended.
- A user reachable both directly and through a group gets one email and one
  approval slot.
- The group pickers list every group defined in Admin → Groups.

### Editing the lists (Apply changes / Discard)

In the Workflow tab, list edits are **staged** so it is always clear what is
about to change:

- Newly added people or groups show as a green chip marked **new**.
- Removed entries stay visible, crossed out and marked **removing**, with an
  **undo** control to put them back.
- A caption below the list summarises pending edits, e.g.
  *"2 to add, 1 to remove — not yet applied."*
- **Apply changes** is greyed out until something has changed. **Discard**
  reverts to the saved list. After applying, the list renders normally.
- The Managed toggle, Approval mode and Notification delay are single values
  and still save immediately when changed.

### Email

Every step sends mail through the normal Wiki.js mail settings
(Admin → Mail): watch digests, draft submitted, draft rejected, approval
requested, changes requested. Links in the emails use the site host configured
in Admin → General.

---

## Administration and presentation

### Mail-failure alert

Because the workflow depends on email, a failed send must not be silent. If a
message cannot be sent (SMTP error, or mail not configured when something tried
to send), every **administrator** sees a red banner on every page:

> Email delivery is failing — N message(s) could not be sent. Notifications may not be reaching users.

with **Mail settings** and **Dismiss** buttons. Dismissing clears the alert; it
reappears on the next failure. This detects send failures; bounces after
delivery are not tracked.

### Private site

Admin → General → **Private site**. Hides the social share targets (Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Telegram, Viber, Weibo, WhatsApp) from a page's
share menu, leaving only **Copy URL** and **Email**.

### Hide "Powered by Wiki.js"

Admin → General → **Hide "Powered by Wiki.js"**. Removes the attribution from
the page footer, which also removes it from printed output.

### Print QR code

Admin → General → **Print QR code**. When a page is printed (browser Print or
Save as PDF), a small QR code linking back to the live page is placed in the
page-title header, to the right of the title. Useful on printed procedures so
readers can jump to the current version.

### Customizable load/save animation

Admin → Theme → **Loading & Saving Animation**. Choose the spinner shown while
pages load (top bar) and save (editor progress dialog): **20 presets**, a
**colour**, and a **speed**, with a live preview. One setting covers both.

### Git build info

Admin → System Info → **Git Build** row: branch, short commit and commit date
of the running build. Works for Docker images from the release pipeline, for
bare-metal installs from a git checkout, and in development. If nothing is
known the row is hidden.

---

## Deploying and upgrading

Each release publishes a Docker image and a bare-metal tarball:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/arsenixprime/wiki:2.5.314_jp2
```

Pin a version tag rather than `:latest` on production hosts, and confirm the
upgrade took effect in Admin → System Info → **Git Build**. Database migrations
run automatically at start-up; the workflow features add tables on first boot.
SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server are all supported.

To cut a new release, push a tag `v<upstream>_jpN` to the fork; the
`release-fork` GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes it.

## Keeping this page current

Add a row to **Release history** and a section (or a bullet) under the
relevant heading whenever a fork feature ships. The authoritative copy lives in
the repository at `dev/docs/fork-features.md`; paste the latest version here
after each release.
